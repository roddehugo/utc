# SY31 - Sensors for Intelligent Systems

## Objective
The purpose of this course is to acquire the concepts, theoretical and practical tools necessary for basic measurements principles. We studied sensors like ultrasonic, cameras, rangefinders, accelerometers. A part of this course is dedicated to information processing and integration in intelligent systems (vision, robots, vehicles).
